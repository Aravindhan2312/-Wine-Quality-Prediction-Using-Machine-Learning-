# -Wine-Quality-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-# 

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting the quality of wine based on various chemical properties. By applying machine learning classification algorithms, we aim to accurately categorize wine samples into quality levels. This real-world dataset is widely used in viticulture analytics and provides a great foundation for hands-on machine learning practice.
